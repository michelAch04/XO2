Hey! This repository is a project I worked on with the help of my colleague, Joe Msann (Github: JoeMsann), during our 3rd year as computer engineers.
This is a website that was implemented using Google Firebase, and is about a game that we used to play to pass time during break hours called Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe.
It is an advanced version of the tic-tac-toe game, and we tried to implement it as an online game that anyone can play for free!
This website was submitted as our Web Programming course's final project.
Happy Coding!


Update 2/6/2025: We haven't had the time to fix the website, but we will try as soon as possible!
